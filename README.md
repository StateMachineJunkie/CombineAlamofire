# CombineAlamofire
Exploration of the use of `Combine`, which is new to me, in networking and UI development. For the last two years, I've been using `Moya` and `RxSwift`. I'd like to transition to `Combine` in order to reduce the number of third-party dependencies in my projects going forward. Thus, the need to learn `Combine`. I really enjoy functional-reactive programming and look forward to finding new ways to apply it in app development. Additionally, I'll be discarding `Carthage` and `CocoaPods` in favor of `Swift Package`s. I hope Apple has worked out most of the early bugs I encounted last time I tried to leave `Carthage` behind.
